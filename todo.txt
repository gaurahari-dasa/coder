1. Add textarea option
2. Add SearchDown option
3. Add MultiSelect option
4. Add input type "time"
5. If the underlying DB column is non-null, Required option must be checked by default
6. Use select element in UI for selecting the morphing type - file, date-time, date-only
7. When the UI has a file upload, the editForm must include a _method: "patch", entry and the method to send the data should be POST
8. When one of the fields is a file, on the server-side - store the file in the filesystem and then use that path for the database column value
9. Add date casts (see below for example) to Eloquent Model for date-only inputs. For these fields, you must also apply date-only morph when outputting (displaying in the grid) 
Note: Y-m-d format specification is applied when serializing these values in JSON and array.

    protected function casts(): array
    {
        return [
            'start_date' => 'date:Y-m-d',
            'end_date' => 'date:Y-m-d',
            'active' => 'boolean',
        ];
    }

10. Also apply date-time morphs **automatically** for columns of datetime input datatypes. User has to choose DateTimeColumn for outputting (displaying in grid). Add datetime casts for the Eloquent model __might__ break existing code.
11. Add set-focus attribute to Vue component tag (this has been missed out actually).
