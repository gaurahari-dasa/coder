As of now for Model specification only one line containing the Model tag is sufficient like so:

*** Model: <model name> ***

For Selecting which data should be exposed from the DB, we use the following tag:

*** SelectData: guides; guide_id ***

The above tag specifies that the guide entities are in the guides table which has a primary key column by name 'guide_id'.

To specify the context foreign table with which this entity has many to one relationship, we need to add the foreign table spec to the SelectData tag like so:

*** SelectData: guides; guide_id, contacts; contact_id ***

What the above spec means is that there can be one or more guides for a single contact entity. In other words, the contacts compartmentalize the guides. The contact entities are in the contacts table with primary key column as contact_id.

Without explicitly specifying the name of the column in the guides table that refers to the contact in the contacts table, it's convened that the column name is same as the foreign table's primary key column's name which is 'contact_id'.

If the actual column is differently named in the guides table, we must specify using the $ spec like so:

contact_id: $(contacts)

The above specification goes into sub-section which is demarcated like so:

** guides **

This means the column 'contact_id' belongs to the 'guides' table and it refers to 'contacts' table. In other words, it's a foreign key column referring to the 'contact_id' column in the 'contacts' table.

Reference specification - the $-spec
------------------------------------
We can also specify that a field in our guide entity takes values from a 'lookup' table. This is done using the reference spec $(). In the example below we have a language_id column in the guides table that refers to the languages table.

language_id: $(language_id)

What the above spec means is that the language_id column in the guides table references the language_id column of the languages table (specified later in the spec). Functionally this means that when editing a guide entity from the grid, the value of language_id is taken from a field of the grid with the same name - not actually - it's the camel cased name. If the grid field had a different name say motherTongueId, then we must specify this as so:

language_id: $(mother_tongue_id)

Note that all the above facts hold if there's a specification following the above like so:

** languages **
language_id as mother_tongue_id
language_name as mother_tongue_name

This technique of aliasing a column is useful when the same table needs to be joined more than one time, e.g., what if there's another column communication_language in the guides table that also refers to the language_id column of the languages table? The language_id column of the guides table will be having the reference specification as shown above and we shall also have the following specification:

communication_language: $(comm_lang_id)

** languages as comm_languages **
language_id as comm_lang_id
language_name as comm_lang_name

Where do I add the i-spec?
--------------------------
As of now we can add the i-spec either to the language_id column specs described above or to a separate language_id column described in it's own (owning) table section like so:
** languages **
language_id: i(select; Language; languages)
name as language_name

But the latter practice is deprecated and bound to be removed in the future. The correct practice is to provide the i-spec to the language_id column described in the section on guides because that's where the data will be persisted.


Which data will be selected for (sent to) the grid?
---------------------------------------------------
All the data points (columns) mentioned in the SelectData section will be selected except for those that are references (foreign keys). This fact holds whether or not the output specs #() are applied. Apart from this, the primary key will be selected even without being explicitly mentioned in the SelectData section. However only those that have output specs (#()) will be displayed in the grid. The rest are hidden in JavaScript objects!


Sort Ordinal
------------
In the future we can have data sorted by multiple columns. The sort ordinal value is the column order in which the data is sorted. For example, if the data is having 3 columns - name, age, mobile. And the data is sorted by name and age columns. The name column can have the sort ordinal value of 1 and the age column can have a sort ordinal value of 2. This means the data is sorted first by name and then by the age column.

As of now data can be sorted only by one column and the sort ordinal for that column must be set as 1. This setting is essential; otherwise a warning is emitted.
